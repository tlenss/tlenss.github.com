    <id>http://lenss.nl/2012/11/publish-google-reader-shared-items</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lot of people are using the shared items feature in <a href="http://www.google.nl/reader/">Google Reader</a> to publish what they are reading on a blog. It's like having a live blogroll widget on your website. And gives your readers a good impression of what you are actually interested in.</p>

<p>I never bothered adding this to my blog. But i do like to share. So last night i was trying to figure out how to integrate this with my current blog. I was hoping for an easy implementation. But the information is scarce. So i had to do some digging. I did find a couple of <a href="https://www.google.nl/search?q=wordpress+plugin+google+reader">Wordpress plugins</a>. But most of them were not updated for at least a year. And i am not putting code like that life on my website.</p>

<p>After some Googling i came across a couple of feed URL's that seem to share their <strong>shared</strong> items in feed form. Using the Google Reader URL and a user id. So the URL for my shared items would look like the one below. Getting your user id by the way is easy. Go to your Google reader page. Click all <strong>All items</strong> and the <strong>UID</strong> will show up in the address bar.</p>

<blockquote><p>http://www.google.com/reader/shared/16525759780220726764</p></blockquote>

<p>The problem with this however. Non of my shared posts show up on this page. And i have not figured out a way to populate it just yet. So i came up with an other path to get this data on my server.</p>

<p>In the Google Reader pages it's possible to add sharing functionality. This is done by going to the <strong>Send To</strong> tab</p>

<p><a href="http://lenss.nl/images/2012/11/Send-To.png"><img src="http://lenss.nl/images/2012/11/Send-To-300x22.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>From here it's possible to select a service to share data with. Non of these services are any good for what i am trying to do. But the great thing about this page is. You can provide custom URL's for sharing data. Just incorporate the specified parameters in the URL and your done.</p>

<p><a href="http://lenss.nl/images/2012/11/Custom-Site.png"><img src="http://lenss.nl/images/2012/11/Custom-Site-300x178.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Once configured and saved a custom URL is visible in the <strong>Send To</strong> panel</p>

<p><a href="http://lenss.nl/images/2012/11/Favorite-Site.png"><img src="http://lenss.nl/images/2012/11/Favorite-Site-300x125.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>That's it for this part. Actually sharing items is quite easy now. When back in the Google Reader under each post there is Send to link. If you click this link the newly created custom URL will show up. And you can share the post.</p>

<p><a href="http://lenss.nl/images/2012/11/Tag-Article.png"><img src="http://lenss.nl/images/2012/11/Tag-Article-300x41.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The only thing left to do is write some code to process the incoming data. To get you started. Some of the code i used while testing this is posted below</p>

<pre><code>Class GoogleReaderShare
{
    const GOOGLE_REMOTE_IP = '95.97.54.3';

    const GOOGLE_REFERER = 'http://www.google.nl/reader/view/';

    protected static $_whitelist = array('source', 'title', 'url', 'short');

    public static function CheckSource($remoteAddr, $referer) 
    {
        if (($remoteAddr == self::GOOGLE_REMOTE_IP) 
                &amp;&amp; ($referer == self::GOOGLE_REFERER)) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    protected static function _CheckIncomingData($data)
    {
        if (!is_array($data)) {
            return false;
        }

        foreach ($data as $key =&gt; $value) {
            if (!in_array($key, self::$_whitelist)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    public static function Process($data) 
    {
        if (!self::_CheckIncomingData($data)) {
            throw new Exception("Unrecognized or no incoming data");
        }

        // process the data
    }
}

if (GoogleReaderShare::CheckSource($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'])) {
    GoogleReaderShare::Process($_GET);
}

    <link href="http://lenss.nl/2012/10/workaround-ubuntu-12-04-mysterious-system-freezes/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-12T15:43:46+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://lenss.nl/2012/10/workaround-ubuntu-12-04-mysterious-system-freezes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have two machines running <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/">Ubuntu 12.04</a>. One of them is very stable. And hardly ever gets rebooted. The other machine is displaying some odd behavior every now and then. And with odd behavior i mean. It just completely freezing up. The only thing functioning at that moment is the mouse.</p>

<p>I use this machine daily. And i can't afford to lose work due to system crashes. So i could spend numerous hours trying to figure out what's going on. But that's probably something better left for the Ubuntu devs them selfs. Besides that there are plenty of bug reports floating around that describe this behavior. And one of those <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/999910">posts</a> seemed to resolve the issue for me.</p>

<p>Apparently the bug that causes these crashes is fixed in 12.10. But the changes will only be backported when 12.10 is released. So that leaves me in quite a pickle. But according to the thread. Upgrading the kernel should do the trick. So that's exactly what i did. The kernel packages i used can be found here <a href="http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.4-precise/">http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.4-precise/</a></p>

<blockquote><p>$ wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.4-precise/linux-headers-3.4.0-030400_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_all.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i linux-headers-3.4.0-030400_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_all.deb</p>

<p>$ wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.4-precise/linux-headers-3.4.0-030400-generic_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i linux-headers-3.4.0-030400-generic_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_amd64.deb</p>

<p>$ wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.4-precise/linux-image-3.4.0-030400-generic_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i linux-image-3.4.0-030400-generic_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_amd64.deb</p></blockquote>

<p>This comes with a downside of course. All modules compiled for the current kernel need to be recompiled. And i haven't figured out how to rebuild all of them at once. So i just ran the command below for <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> and the <a href="http://www.nvidia.com">NVidia</a> drivers.</p>

<blockquote><p>$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure package-name</p></blockquote>

<p>It's probably a better idea to keep the stable kernel for now. But if system crashes are really bugging you. Then this might resolve the issue. Just be careful.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Using SSH key authentication with EGit in ZendStudio]]></title>
    <link href="http://lenss.nl/2012/02/using-ssh-key-authentication-with-egit-in-zendstudio/"/>
    <updated>2012-02-28T16:17:19+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://lenss.nl/2012/02/using-ssh-key-authentication-with-egit-in-zendstudio</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past few months i have been switching some projects over to <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> from <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>. And have been trying to get the hang of all the command line options available. And i will be doing that for a while longer until i get completely comfortable. And for communication to the remote git server i have been using SSH key authentication. Which works smoothly just like it did with Subversion.</p>

<p>But i wanted to check out the GIT support available in <a href="http://www.zend.com/products/studio/">Zend Studio 9</a>. And hit a problem pretty quickly. But i will describe that below. First i will create a local clone of my git project.</p>

<blockquote><p>$ git clone ssh://[somehost]/~/git/project.git</p></blockquote>

<p>To test if everything is working i do a test commit. If that succeeds if push it out to the remote master.</p>

<blockquote><p>$ cd project.git
$ touch TEST
$ git commit
$ git push origin master</p></blockquote>

<p>So that works fine. Now time to see how Zen Studio handles this. To create a project i use the <strong>Create from Git</strong> option. And select the local checkout i just created. This will read the whole repository configuration. And you are basically done from here. But as i mentioned earlier, i had some difficulties getting things running smoothly. I discovered that when it was time to push changes to the master repository.</p>

<p>When i used the <strong>Push to Upstream</strong> option. I was greeted by a login panel that seemed to have selected the correct SSH key and user to perform the login. But when i typed the password, it just kept asking for the password. Again and again. Hmm. That sucks! The password was correct. I tried with a newly created key. No luck either. The last thing i tried was updating to a nightly build of <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/egit/">Egit</a> found <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/">here</a>. But this offered no solution either.</p>

<p>After reading a couple of complaints i found this <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=326526">bug</a> report for the EGit eclipse plugin. The thread contains a solution for the login issue i was having. Gotta love Google!</p>

<p>Apparently the problem has to do with the encryption algorithm used to create the SSH keys. In this case the EGit plugin (which uses <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/">Jsch</a> to do the SSH communication) was having problems with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a> encrypted keys. And to solve the problem the Jsch library should be replaced with a newer version to make things work again.</p>

<p>So lets download this JSch library and update it manually. The library (JSch v 0.1.46) can be found <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>$ cd ZendStudio9
$ find . -name '<em>jsch</em>' -type f</p></blockquote>

<p>Found it <strong>plugins/com.jcraft.jsch_0.1.41.v201101211617.jar</strong>. So let's try to update that.</p>

<blockquote><p>$ cp plugins/com.jcraft.jsch_0.1.41.v201101211617.jar plugins/com.jcraft.jsch_0.1.41.v201101211617.jar.backup
$ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsch/files/jsch.jar/0.1.46/jsch-0.1.46.jar/download
$ mv jsch-0.1.46.jar plugins/com.jcraft.jsch_0.1.41.v201101211617.jar</p></blockquote>

<p>After restarting ZS everything worked fine again. Another problem solved! Thanks to the guys who posted in the EGit bug thread. Some good community Karma here! Time for other things. Hope it helps!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Recruiter rant]]></title>
    <link href="http://lenss.nl/2012/02/recruiter-rant/"/>
    <updated>2012-02-21T23:14:03+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://lenss.nl/2012/02/recruiter-rant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While doing our routine <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/agiledevelopmentsite/process/sprint-retrospective">sprint retrospective</a> today. We got interrupted by our office manager Wendy. An important phone call for me. Hmm... Should have known.</p>

<p>I picked up the phone. And the guy (<a href="http://www.amoriabond.com/">Amoria Bond</a>) on the other end immediately started his sales pitch. O shit another one of those nasty recruiters. So after listening to him for a few seconds i quickly interrupted him. Told him i was not interested in a new job at all. And that he was a jerk and extremely unprofessional for calling me at the office. Completely unaware (or maybe intentionally?) what impact this might have if for instance my manager picks up the phone. Besides it's just plain rude.</p>

<p>Now don't get me wrong. It's not a rant for nothing. I don't hate recruiters. And have worked with some professional ones in the past. I've always enjoyed communicating with linda-lotte while she was still working for <a href="http://www.recruit4it.nl/">Recruit4it</a>. And the guys at <a href="http://www.starapple.nl">Starapple</a> are OK as well. But this guy today really pissed me off with his aggressive unmannered approach. It's a shame i didn't catch his name while i was in rant mode. But please don't ever call me again.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>It seems to be some form of new tactic to call developers in the office where they work. This happened a couple of times more after this post. So this is for the next recruiter that calls me in the office. I'll personally come over and kick your ass!!</p>
